# Transaction Manager

This project involves the development of a Transaction Manager program and four subprocess programs (adder, subtractor, multiplier, and divider) that perform basic arithmetic operations. The Transaction Manager acts as the main program, creating subprocesses, establishing separate pipelines for each, and managing user interactions. 

a) Adder (adder.c): Adds two numbers and writes the result back to the pipeline. 

b) Subtractor (subtractor.c): Subtracts two numbers and writes the result back to the pipeline.

c) Multiplier (multiplier.c): Multiplies two numbers and writes the result back to the pipeline. 

d) Divider (divider.c): Divides two numbers, handles division by zero, and writes the result back to the pipeline. 

e) Transaction Manager (trmn.c): Manages subprocess creation, pipeline establishment, user interactions, and program termination.
